Hi Drake, 

I could not finish this homework. I became very frustrated when I could not get my assets to go through to the server and ran out of time. 
In order to finish, I need to complete the intake form and compare the information from each "friend."
For each response, I would compare the 1-5 value for their answer and find the differences. Then going through the list of friends
to see which friend had the least amount of difference in their answers. 
I would have also used a materialize card (http://materializecss.com/cards.html) to display this information because I think it would look
like old-fashioned info cards in cartoons ex Carmen San Diego. 

Some other notes for myself when I review this assignment: 
1. I got very overwhelmed by all of the files and folders for this project. I will need to find a better way of keeping this organized. 
When I moved or changed something it was hell to track down and make the adjustments. These projects are only going to get bigger and 
more complicated.

2. WTF with the static files, it looked like everything was working and then boom 404 not found. I need to look for a tutorial on this, 
It was extremely annoying. I spent most of my tutoring session trying to fix it, and she couldn't get it either. 

3. Allocation of resources. Normally I like to write my js and have everything working in the command line BEFORE I dick with the front end. 
This time I thought I would throw that together (I used a template it really did come together fast) and then have something nice to look at while I got my code working. It didn't work that way and I will return to my previous method.
